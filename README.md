Exercises for Cracking the Coding Interview
Chapter 1 Arrays and Strings:
1) Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structure?\n
2) Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string\n
3) Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other\n
4) Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the- string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the true length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)\n
1.4bis) Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. Example: Tact Coa  -> True   (e.g. taco cat, atco cta, etc)
